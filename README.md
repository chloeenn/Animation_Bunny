# Animation Bunny üêá  

This project is a bunny animation created using **WebGL**. The main goal of this project is to practice texture mapping using WebGL.  

## Features  
- **WebGL-Based Rendering**: Real-time animation of a bunny object.  
- **Texture Mapping Practice**: Explore and apply textures to enhance the object‚Äôs appearance.  
- **Starter Code**: Built upon provided starter files (`Object.js`, `main.html`).  

## Project Files  
- **`main.js`**: The main contribution of this project. Contains the implementation of texture mapping and animation logic.  
- **`Object.js`**: Provided as starter code to define object structures and helpers.  
- **`main.html`**: The initial HTML file for setting up the WebGL canvas and linking resources.
